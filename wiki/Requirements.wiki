#summary here is what we want this project to do

= Introduction =

After reviewing the code again before starting to upgrade to jme3, I discovered that the current configuration of the sourcecode would probably Not work for jME3. So i decided to reorganize a bit first, starting with what we want the console to be capable of.


= Requirements =

So here is the requirements for the jME Game Console:
  * The jME Game Console shall be compatible with jME3 Alpha 4 and later
  * the console shall be capable of executing java code in realtime and temporarily modify the game
  * the console shall be easy to use
  * the console shall be easy to add to your jME project with as little code as possible (preferrably no more than two or three lines to add a simple console)
  * the console shall be capable of running script files of any supported languages
  * the consoles code shall be logically organized in a way that allows for easy modification of the game console.
